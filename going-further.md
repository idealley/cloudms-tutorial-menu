# Going Further

* Using [Vue JS](https://vuejs.org/)
* Server Side Rendering
* Hot Reloading
* Webpack

### Vue JS

Vue is "a progressive web framework". it means that you can include Vue in any html page as you do with Jquery, and you will get a lot of Vue's features like reactivity and two ways data binding. But you can go further and use Vue as a "full stack" frontend framework, with server side rendering to have SEO etc. This, of course, is not straight forward as you need to put in place a "development pipeline" as you need to compile your javascript, your_ scss_ or _less_ etc. 

When you use Vue as a full stack framework you have the additional benefit of using the latest features of javascript as well as web components.
