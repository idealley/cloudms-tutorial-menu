# Breadcrumb parser

We want to display a breadcrumb for items that belong to a menu. Thus we need to use the item that we are displaying at the root of our path and walk up to the menu it belongs to. We need to produce a path for each items of the breadcrumb so that the visitors of the website could click on items of the breadcrumb and navigate backwards.
