# How to manage menus with Cloud CMS

Using the graph database properties of Cloud CMS, it is possible to use Cloud CMS not only to manage your content, but also the menu, or the navigation on the site that displays this content.

The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate:

* How to use Cloud CMS and its graph capabilities to create a menu graph
* Link this menu to content
* Retrieve and display the menu
* Automatically display a breadcrumb \(you are here: somewhere &gt; some article\) (still improving this feature)
* Display a breadcrumb for articles that are in a category but not necessarily linked to a menu item \(newspaper do not add all their articles in the sport menu\)

* Automatically generate sitemaps for search engines.

First, we will create some content, then, we will create a menu and link menu items to content items whether it is category or article.

This demo was build based on the [express Cloud CMS sdk](https://github.com/gitana/sdk/tree/master/helloworld-express).

You can find the accompanying code in [this github repository](https://github.com/idealley/cloudcms-manage-menus)

Letâ€™s define what we mean by category and articles. An article, is the content itself. It is a single content item, like a news article or a product description, a category is a set of articles arbitrarily grouped. This is the sport section of a newspaper. It displays all the sport articles. Of course there are different ways of grouping articles.

We could create a menu that generates itself based on the nesting of articles and categories, and we could apply this tutorial to it, by adding or modifying very few properties to existing content, but we prefer the decoupled version as it allows to keep the menu structure and change the target of a menu item at any point. It even allows to have many menu items linking to one article.

The green node represent the content graph, the blue one the menu graph. Nodes that link the menu to the content are the purple ones. Notice that the graph is directed, this means that the relations between nodes have a direction, either `INCOMING` or `OUTGOING`, this is represented by the arrow end.

`(A)-->(B)<--(C)`

We can say that node `A` and `C` have each one `OUTGOING` relation and that node `B` has two `INCOMING` relations. This notation is the Cypher language \(we will use it freely\), it is very expressive and easy to understand in order to describe nodes and relations. We will be using it when we need to describe the relations and structure. It is not a feature of Cloud CMS.
